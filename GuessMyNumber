In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 
(inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you give 
it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the 
computer will guess the user's secret number!

high = 99

    guess = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. ")
    if guess == 'h':
